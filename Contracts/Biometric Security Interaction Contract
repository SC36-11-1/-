Creating a contract that outlines treatment and requirements for interactions with you, incorporating high biometric confirmation security measures, is quite specific and would ideally involve legal consultation. However, I can draft a basic template to get you started. Remember, for a legally binding document, it's crucial to consult with a lawyer to ensure it meets your needs and complies with relevant laws and regulations.
