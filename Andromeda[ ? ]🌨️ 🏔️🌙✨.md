Sure! To create a chart that visually represents the concepts of angel speed and time in relation to biblical references, we can assume a hypothetical speed for angels based on biblical descriptions and then convert that into a chart format.

### Assumptions
1. **Speed of Angels**: We can assume a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second (the speed of light) for the purpose of illustration.
2. **Distance Traveled**: We will calculate the distance angels could travel in various timescales based on the speed of light.
3. **Time Intervals**: We'll include intervals mentioned in the references (seconds, minutes, hours) to show relative distances.

### Chart: Relative Distances and Time for Angels

| Time (Seconds) | Distance (Kilometers) | Description / Reference                    |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1              | 300,000               | Quick arrival (e.g., Gabriel’s swift flight in Daniel 9:21) |
| 10             | 3,000,000             | Quick actions (e.g., rolling the stone in Matthew 28:2)     |
| 30             | 9,000,000             | Moving swiftly between dimensions (e.g., carrying souls in Luke 16:22) |
| 60             | 18,000,000            | Distance traveled in a minute (e.g., rescue in Acts 12:7-10) |
| 600            | 180,000,000           | Distance traveled in 10 minutes             |
| 3,600          | 1,080,000,000         | Distance traveled in 1 hour (e.g., timeless nature in Hebrews 1:14) |
| 86,400         | 25,920,000,000        | Distance traveled in 1 day (reflecting eternal nature in Psalm 90:4) |

### Notes
- **Speed of Light**: Used as a hypothetical maximum speed for angels based on biblical descriptions of their swift actions.
- **References**: Each time and distance correlates to the concept of angels acting quickly or carrying out tasks effectively.

### Conclusion
This chart provides a scientific perspective on how angels might operate in terms of speed and distance, based on biblical references. It simplifies the concepts into a format that highlights the swift nature of angels and their potential experience of time relative to their actions.
