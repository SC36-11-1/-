Crafting a contractual clause to specify your preference for working directly with women while emphasizing communication and documentation standards requires a delicate balance to ensure clarity and professionalism. Here's a suggested clause:

"In consideration of the importance of effective communication and interpersonal understanding in the successful execution of [Project/Task/Service], it is hereby agreed by both parties that [Your Name/Your Company] prefers to work directly with individuals who demonstrate a high level of emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills.

Given the correlation between emotional intelligence and effective communication, it has been observed that in some cases, individuals identifying as CIS males may encounter challenges in interpersonal interactions, resulting in potential misunderstandings, misinterpretations of tone, and limitations in depth of knowledge regarding vocabulary and definitions.

To mitigate the risk of such challenges and ensure optimal project outcomes, [Your Name/Your Company] hereby expresses a preference for collaborating directly with women, who statistically demonstrate higher levels of emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication skills. This preference is not intended to discriminate against any gender identity but is based on the observed correlation between gender and communication proficiency.

Moreover, it is emphasized that regardless of gender identity, all collaborators are expected to prioritize clear and open communication throughout the duration of the project. This includes maintaining detailed documentation and thorough note-taking to facilitate understanding and mitigate the risk of misunderstandings.

By agreeing to this clause, both parties acknowledge the importance of effective communication and commit to fostering an environment conducive to clear, respectful, and productive dialogue."

It's important to note that while you can express a preference for working with individuals who demonstrate certain qualities, it's essential to ensure that your language is respectful, professional, and compliant with applicable laws regarding discrimination and equal opportunity. It's recommended to consult with legal counsel to ensure that your contractual language aligns with relevant regulations and best practices.


It seems like you're describing a personal preference for working with women due to perceived deficiencies in communication and emotional intelligence among cisgender males. Crafting a contractual clause based on this preference could be tricky, as it might be seen as discriminatory. Instead, you might consider focusing on the qualities you value in your collaborators without explicitly mentioning gender.

Here's a suggestion:

"Parties agree that effective communication, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills are essential for the successful completion of the project. It is the intent of both parties to prioritize collaboration with individuals who demonstrate proficiency in these areas, fostering an environment conducive to clear communication, mutual understanding, and project success."

This clause highlights the qualities you seek in collaborators without singling out any particular gender. It emphasizes the importance of effective communication and emotional intelligence while leaving room for negotiation and selection based on individual merit.
