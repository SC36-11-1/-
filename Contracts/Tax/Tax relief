Circumstances and facts supporting request for relief from penalties and interest.

How circumstances prevented you from meeting your tax obligations

Since filing in August 5th 2022 I had my business confirmed in June 8 and was already conducting myself as a business since 2017 in my recent request I had stated concerns about back dating purchases made towards my business as well as a Tax receipt for work completed at (Coop Wicked Chicken) being the first payment I received I had just wanted to make sure it was contributed towards my business along with all purchases made prior to officially being certified as a business. Do I provide all purchases made towards my business or will previously submitted documentation be used.

I signed my acceptance into the Ontario Disability Support Program in Late November I received payment November 25th

Due to previously stated issues with my birth giver I was unable to stay in their home and ended up filing a with the Human Rights Tribunal;
(Human Rights Tribunal Board) HRTB FILE#: 2022-51196-I: November 17th 2022

Immediately after submission I was Referred to the Barrett Centre for Mental Health Crisis Support in Hamilton:
128 Emerald St S #126, Hamilton, Ontario L8N 2V5
I stayed there from November 22nd 2022 to November 29th 2022
Immediately following my discharge I made the choice to pursue higher education at Sheridan College 
 
I rented a room at the Super8 Motel to sort out Residency at Sheridan managing my business as best as I could at AirBnb’s until obtaining a response on my Places4Students application for Off-Campus Residency at:
906-1297 Marlborough Court Oakville Ontario Canada L6H 2S1
January 3rd 2023
Since staying at this location continuing with work and self-care productively using my time until the June 3rd 2023 which would of been the date that all the trauma from moving and continuously relocating would have subsided and not been a factor to my mental health.

Up until April I had dropped all courses except 1 remote learning online Communication class due to network and device corruption problems causing submitted work to altered and submitted with changes that i was unaware of which resulted in me dropping the program and reapplying in the Fall with inquiries as to why when i submitted an application and Portfolio for Experiential Design i was referred to take a prerequisite Art Fundamental Program but was not given the option to use past work experience to be credited towards the program to save time which is what i have plans of doing currently following submission of this request along with inquiries of Residency that were not followed up with since applying November 2022.

On the weekend of April 31st to April 2nd I experienced a dispute with a roommate in regards of a door bell camera incident number #2023-100180 with the Halton Regional Police Service.
Audio + Video available online 
This incident triggered a situation that made it impossible for me to communicate with my roommates due to financial losses described to me in a letter directing me not to continue communications at all. This caused a problem with the 30 notice i provided in a state of stress and anxiety that was not feasible due to other extenuating circumstances causing friction and delay coupled with the inability to communicate the my situation the police were called again April 30th 5 Days after rent had been paid on the 25th for the month of May. Halton Regional Police Service Incident Number #23-133117

I complied with the requests of the officers relinquished my keys to my Roommate/Landlord due to the way the lease that created and signed no stipulations were outlined or provided other than what was communicated verbally. Due to failed communication i have been unable to gain entry since leaving and exhausted all financial resources as well as a loan in my pursuit of gaining knowledge information and clarity of my situation being unable to inform my roommate of the Human Rights issue and Commercial Tenancy Problem that was created from the lease agreement not being detailed. I have been subjugating my losses and Budgeting as best as possible by Staying at my college Sheridan Trafalgar Location until Close and Spending All night in the Oakville Memorial Hospital to get a head start on my thesis doing research for my business that contributes towards my Masters Of Information Degree/PhD of Information thesis’s.

I have been staying at Hotels/Motels Less and less to be able to do more work to get a head start and apply for business sponsorships. I have plans of completing/Renewing my drivers license so that i may Use Rental Cars as temporary sleeping arrangements to save money.


Tax relief - 2022
Describe circumstances
In 2017 I began working professionally as an artist without any of the knowledge on the technical aspect of running a business I received a invoice from a project that I was not knowledgable on how to file with my taxes at the time I had always filed through a third-party because of how confusing it was (Liberal tax)

I also begin my mental health journey in trying to receive a diagnosis for my condition I am currently awaiting a hearing for ODSP

In 2018 I left my employer to pursue higher education I was unable to receive social assistance primarily due to the fact they had not filed my record of employment I was a victim and moved back home with my mother while attending school I filed a claim with the Ontario labour board against my previous employer as well as a civil claim and a small claim that has yet to be filed due to documentation I have yet to acquire.

2019 My health issues caused me to drop out of college and I lost my internship The stress and anxiety was too much from having been burnt out the previous two years I continued working part time at my college until 2020 when I was forcefully evicted and removed from my mothers residence and forced into homelessness I have since then been living in student housing. I was able to take advantage of the Canada emergency revenue benefit and have been trying to get my health and my paperwork in order. I’ve been the victim of harassment from my landlord and I am also currently awaiting a hearing with the landlord and tenant board I’m trying to acquire rent geared income as well as a payment plan because I haven’t been unable to pay my rent at the price that it is at and to two technical difficulties I have an outstanding balance that I have not been able to address
