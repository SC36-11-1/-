having someone assume your name and use your number just so someone can yell at you and trip you out is so boomer she knows your using my identity but im not scared its 2023!

Social issue stated with initial psychologist to be reasonable given the circumstance of the people whom i am taking to court with connections and power it makes sense random people whole be aware 

reason why i always interact in regards to relationships is online due to personal and public safety of other its just bettre and less invasive to peoples space and life if you let them choose to interact while letting them see you in public working

Using a public known ipad with all information posted on my pastebin. Opening myself up to hacking having previous experience with malicious cyber attacks and childhood experience being ‚Äúbait‚Äù ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù for police operations against child molesters and predators, my teen life was filled with similar instances of targeting for the purpose of creating an opportunity  

 I have turned myself and my devices into Social engineering honey pot. Due to the level of monitoring i have forcefully subject to as a result of legal action taken against those i felt had wronged me i inevitably set myself on a thin path a ‚Äúslack line‚Äù 

Being used an accessory to achieve certain ends i leaned into the role that was being labelled and painted on me ‚ÄúThe shiniest fishing lure‚Äù

    Obeservation due to level slave to bed ODSP patients with people who speak for them no wonder they make it so they can speak for you and make it seem as if your aggressive and incappable of composure. Renting an appartment is expensive but not a room and I only have an issue with people jeapordizing my job security because they need me to stay on disability to be able to keep speaking for me while i work on projects always slowed down by conversations already predispositioned with negative outcomes where im not taken seriously enough 98 Sussex Seems to be the ODSP file that was originally filled out prior to mine was for a bed ridden faceless Bitwayiki Elias(since needed sin to be legit) since i blew that the only avenue he had left to challenege me is psychology but ive been tested since i painted with blood and learned how shitty human brains are 


    Since ODSP provides Body doubles and a lot of services people had to ruin for me beofre i could actually use them while assuming i was the 1st application entry instead of someone waiting for a legitimate document they used excessive Gas Medical manipulation everything to try and currupt and discredit anything i would say luckily working on projects kept my mind aligned with relity enough to endure and file paperwork acordingly until eviction. so now because i couldnt figure out what the fuck was going on they have decided to kill me with unfortunate circumstance being last using public relations as a means to choke you out of resources given the influx of homeless people i can attribute this so each ethnicity that was in that house and wronged since they were living honestly while doing thier job unbenounced to me knowing or having been informed of anything reacting and responding in the absolute worst way imagineable but i was initially kind and positive which allowed me to see that i was not ment to figure it out due to how far the rabbit hole went i was given 2 options of slavery both of which would end with me dead so better i die in my own truth since whatever has happenened theyve been drugging me while sleeping and have taken the route of "Homless suicidal Junkie" But thats nothing new due to addrenaline issues as a child over production blah blah blah secret origins


    Sheridan rug pull education but still plans to continue Halton Police + Halton Memorial Hospital + Sheridan all have corrections to make in my regards to education 

    due to the Project initially started in the 98 resident having to due with crypto or CERB money or a rug was pulled and people are being made to believe i am owner of the account or have some controle when its someone playing musical chairs with Online ODSP files to manipulate situations and identities I ahve doubled down and have been contiueing to work on both projects UX and Crpyto To finance each other while drawing attention from one to another

    IF someone proveds food for you by stealing from people who already want to use that money to buy food with you how is the thief better than the person with honest intentions, if the enemy of my enemy is my friend sooner or later you meet an someone who becomes an enemy or is already an enemy of your friend or or your enemies enemie making every 4th person your friend stupid logic gate, Lying is so stupid. Who needs to grow im already grown since i was imported mans tryna act like they can claim educating me by lying but knowing enough to keep lying consistantly buying time to steal project ideas to sell Tangerine Card LOL too much psychic imprints on things the Kool-aid is supposed to be controled by me not some random buy who gets himself drunk by keeping me selfishly in an internet private server as a slave instead of master with unlimited permissions who kows how many ideas were repressed.
    
trying to get people mad at me for his own racist perceptions of the world why is it so important to black people im treated stereotypically but when i do everything correctly and get accepted im looked at as if i did something wrong when communication is all there is...no one would believe my relationship with my mom is bad because jealously due to relationship levels of raport with siblings i have not shared with my mom on the same level due to a language barrier issue projected on to me who the fuck would believe that its more believeable i was hit with lightning .. the barret center people already know this idek 

My rising sun moleskin pencil idea INDIGO WORKBOOK was stolen but also secret honey pot (Same colour as honey) with a bunch of pencil entries you wouldnt be able to decrypt without assistance since im technically still employed thats a company mad on my behalf idk what they want safe to assume everything not just my work 

Also if my initial crypto project went off i would of been able to supprot like 3 families but obviously spoken with complete transparency im ace and way too open minded if you havent noticed to the point its an issue. racist people hate stereotypical people who fit the discription of negative stereotypes i had the time to talk to a dude with a giant swastica  burned into his chest LOL obvi racist but didnt mind me since questioned and obviously modern kind hearted thinking why is this so hard read the book anyway fuck the cover 

DiagoBar Work Hours Inspired me to create a type of Fiat for my coin Narating my Project as a develop it inside a different research project (if every homeless person self employed as a user experience subject they would get off the street fast just needs to be automated for people differently intelegent crypto thinking different currencies like Blood Donation, Time spent in locations, time spent doing work, ect... working on it since public security cameras on the street validate location and identity)

I guess the best part about this forced social experiment is the fact that it's forced me making the best out of a bad situation while people abuse this to make people think I have money and I'm refusing to secure housing for myself as an exhibitionist this further goes to prove how stupid it is because I don't do enough to pretend to be homeless because I'm still in the library working on it project to make money instead of pretending to be homeless all the time it's weird how I only pretend to be homeless when I'm looking for housing but other than that, I'm working on my project as if someone made the situation to force  one of two options both stupid 

so now we have to write about the good Shepherd because why would you have to be a resident to get assistance with housing if they can just keep you homeless and then you can check in when they open I'm not gonna argue with the idiot. I'll just let other people deal with that shit who do you call rightexactly just post it online and everybody who reads about it deal with it because try again tomorrow on somebody else's shift. This is   exactly just post it online and everybody who reads about it deal with it because try again tomorrow on somebody else's shift this is how they keep homeless and it progresses and then they use the excuse that you're stupid but then why am I working on such a highly intellectual project in my free time  stupid questions that nobody wants to answer because you'll obviously be the one who created the situation if you have any information on it 

I hope I die, because that blows up everything and it's the most honest death. It's what they would deserve actually to be honest waste my time.

they have to keep pretending not to see me because the excuses that I wasted someone's time when I have always just stayed in my room and had other people Lie about everything while I stay working by myself not interacting with anyone while everyone knows I don't have new friends and I'm always online I left dirty looks because it's reinforced with the probability of an extremely sad outcome that I want to have it so I can just get it next version of this dumb game

I have to jump through the stupid hoops I guess it'll just keep being more stupid until I get fed up with it, and just let myself fall victim to suicidal ideation and tendencies but then again, that's just breaking the initial promise of not killing myself, so I don't know we'll just have to keep making public posts about our activities in regards to 135 Mary St., good Shepherd Centre turning us down legitimately without following any type of procedure and making it seem as of speaking publicly outside changes anything when it's just people doing whatever they want me not caring because I know better

you're hoping I get tired of trying again that's what I'm waiting for myself as well that's the day you get to say I killed myself and you'll bother me until then until I go to the court for my pardon so that all these private investigations and secret investigations get fucked

Creating a narrative script involves careful planning and organization to ensure that you cover all the necessary topics effectively. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you prepare a narrative script:

1. **Define Your Purpose:**
   - Clearly identify the purpose of your narrative script. What message or information do you want to convey? Understanding your goal will guide the structure and content of your script.

2. **Outline the Key Topics:**
   - List the main topics you want to cover in your script. These could be events, themes, or concepts that contribute to your overall message. Ensure these topics align with your purpose.

3. **Organize the Structure:**
   - Divide your script into sections, such as introduction, main points, and conclusion. Each section should flow logically from one to the next. Use headings or markers for different topics to stay organized.

4. **Create a Strong Introduction:**
   - Capture your audience's attention from the beginning. Clearly state your purpose and introduce the main topics you'll be covering. Set the tone for your narrative.

5. **Develop Each Topic:**
   - Dedicate a section of your script to each key topic. Provide relevant details, examples, and anecdotes to illustrate your points. Ensure a smooth transition between topics.

6. **Include Supporting Evidence:**
   - If applicable, incorporate data, quotes, or references to support your narrative. This adds credibility to your script and helps reinforce your message.

7. **Maintain a Consistent Tone:**
   - Keep a consistent tone throughout your script. Whether it's formal, informal, serious, or light-hearted, maintaining a consistent tone enhances the overall cohesiveness of your narrative.

8. **Create Transitions:**
   - Use transitions between topics to ensure a smooth flow. This could be a sentence that links one idea to the next or a brief summary of what was covered.

9. **Summarize and Conclude:**
   - Recap the main points and restate your purpose in the conclusion. Make sure your audience leaves with a clear understanding of your message.

10. **Practice and Revise:**
    - Practice reading your script aloud. This helps you identify any awkward phrasing, unclear points, or missing information. Revise as needed to improve clarity and coherence.

11. **Seek Feedback:**
    - Share your script with others and seek constructive feedback. Others may provide valuable insights and help you refine your narrative.

12. **Edit for Clarity and Conciseness:**
    - Review your script for unnecessary details or repetitions. Aim for clarity and conciseness to keep your audience engaged.

Remember, adapting your script based on your audience's needs and preferences is crucial. Be receptive to feedback and make adjustments accordingly.

"13 Reasons Why" is a television series that originally premiered on Netflix in March 2017. The show, created by Brian Yorkey, is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Jay Asher. It gained significant attention and sparked discussions due to its exploration of sensitive and controversial topics, particularly teenage suicide, bullying, and sexual assault.

The narrative revolves around the story of Hannah Baker, a high school student who dies by suicide. Before her death, Hannah records a series of cassette tapes explaining the reasons why she took her own life. Each tape is dedicated to a specific person who played a role in her decision. The show follows Clay Jensen, a classmate who receives the tapes, as he tries to understand the events leading to Hannah's suicide.

While the series aimed to address important issues such as mental health, bullying, and sexual assault, it also faced criticism for its graphic depiction of suicide and the potential impact it might have on vulnerable viewers. Mental health professionals, educators, and organizations expressed concerns about the show's portrayal of suicide and the potential for it to glamorize or romanticize self-harm.

The controversy surrounding the show prompted Netflix to add content warnings and resources related to mental health before episodes featuring explicit scenes. The discussion around "13 Reasons Why" also contributed to a broader conversation about the responsibility of media in addressing sensitive topics and the potential impact on viewers.

It's important to note that my information is accurate up until January 2022, and there may have been developments or additional seasons released since then.











I am currently on ODSP having my chemical imbalances altered with things like stomach purging to induce low glucose levels. I have been in therapy all my life and i keep waking up feeling as if i was injected with cortisol i don‚Äôt understand why seeing as ive never had a violent outburst or aggressive tendencies. Ive been dealing with this issue since November 2022. Constantly leaving the housing or rooms in question where i observe myself becoming chemically imbalanced. I cant do anything now but think about suicide and suicidal ideations i have been cutting myself to induce different endorphins but keep being injected with stress hormones and harassed verbally audibly and indirectly over the internet on my compromised devices, ive asked for assistance and have been experiencing delays after delays with no answer i believe my compromised device is responsible for intercepting my calls and emails. If you are able to get into contact with someone who downplays my situation they are facilitating my death
