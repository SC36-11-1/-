    GitHub Education 

    it was honestly me seeing what would happen when I was looking for assistance in regards to a generative art problem I was having with code discovered GitHub Education and applied to see what would happen I wasn't expecting anything and now I'm trying to teach so that I can better understand the subject material while creating a new avenue/content for people to explore. I want to be able to provide assistance that I couldn't find in regards to creative coding Ive been drawing inspiration from people like coding train ([https://youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain](https://t.co/AArdKxK0pT)) and coding boss ([https://portaly.cc/cheyuwu](https://t.co/X0IR8Dvowu))on YouTube to better prepare myself for using this new medium seeing as its fairly new and a niche due to complexity there are not many places providing community like [https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/featuredâ€¦](https://t.co/rOTf39f7tT) or [https://artblocks.io](https://t.co/UKWBHQdRTJ) I have plans of running my own Digital Art Studio and I feel as if there is no better place to start than with education and teaching to make sure I know what I'm talking about instead of just rambling on to myself feedback and students with questions as well as more experience will provide amazing inspiration and learning will be done in leaps and bounds instead of just baby steps like when I was working alone
