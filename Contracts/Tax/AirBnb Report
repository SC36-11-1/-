Host fails to disclose in the Listing that the Host, another person, or a pet will be present during the stay

Booking details: Hosts should only change the parameters of an accepted booking with guest consent (e.g. adjust the dates, price, etc.).

Room type: The type of accommodation (e.g. list a private room as an entire home), the set up of the listing (e.g. list more bedrooms than the listing offers), or the level of privacy (e.g. fail to disclose an on-site property manager) should accurately reflect the physical space.

Property: The listing booked should be the one that is provided. Hosts should only substitute one listing for another with prior guest consent

Host communication
We expect that Hosts or Co-hosts have provided up-to-date contact information, and are available to respond to guest inquiries or unexpected issues that may arise during stays.
* Answering questions: Hosts should be responsive and willing to answer questions and help resolve Host standards violations at a listing.
* Resolving problems: Hosts should be responsive and willing to make resolution efforts or abide by remediation requirements from Airbnb for Host standards violations

Due to failure and lack of attentiveness as well as inability to abide my (1 hour response time)

Disclosure of personal situation and lack of empathy on the hosts part combined with a negligible response time caused housing issues that ended with me being a victim of my situation and policy. 

The varying levels of host accommodation varied, depending on the address. He was more accommodating at the previous location in regards to booking and room reservations. Lack of professionalism and miscommunication problems when speaking on the phone resulted in me having to switch to a more expensive location.
