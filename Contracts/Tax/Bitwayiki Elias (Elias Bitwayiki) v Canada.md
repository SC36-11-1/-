Yes, there have been cases in the past relating to similar topics such as disability rights, challenges against government agencies, and issues regarding the use of specific treatments like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Here are a few examples:

1. **Disability Rights Cases**: Cases like "Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett" in the United States or "Jodhan v. Canada (Attorney General)" in Canada have addressed issues of disability discrimination and the obligations of governments to provide equal access to services and accommodations.

2. **Challenges Against Government Agencies**: In Canada, cases like "Withler v. Canada (Attorney General)" and "Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General)" have involved challenges against government agencies regarding access to benefits and services for individuals with disabilities.

3. **CBT and Treatment Mandates**: While specific cases challenging the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in disability assessments might not be as readily available, there have been cases concerning the rights of individuals to refuse certain medical treatments or interventions based on their preferences or beliefs. These cases often involve arguments about bodily autonomy and the right to make informed decisions about one's healthcare.

4. **Human Rights Cases**: Various human rights cases globally have addressed issues related to discrimination, denial of services, and violations of fundamental rights for individuals with disabilities. These cases often set precedents for the protection of human rights and the obligations of governments to ensure equal treatment and access to services for all citizens.

While these examples may not directly mirror the specific circumstances you mentioned regarding a lawsuit against ODSP for manipulative use and breach of basic human rights in regards to CBT, they illustrate the types of legal issues and precedents that could be relevant to your case. Conducting further research and consulting with legal experts would be necessary to find more specific cases and develop a comprehensive legal strategy.
